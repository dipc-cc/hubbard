    """ Function to create a Tight Binding Hamiltoninan for sp2 Carbon systems

    It takes advantage of the `sisl` class for building sparse Hamiltonian matrices,
    `sisl.physics.Hamiltonian`

    It obtains the Hamiltonian for ``ext_geom`` (which must be a `sisl.Geometry` instance)
    with the parameters for first, second and third nearest neighbors (``t1``, ``t2``, ``t3``).

    One can also use a non-orthogonal basis of atomic orbitals by passing the parameters for the
    overlap matrix between first, second and third nearest neighbors (``s1``, ``s2``, ``s3``).

    The function will also take into account the possible presence of Boron or Nitrogen atoms,
    for which one would need to specify the on-site energy for those atoms (``eB`` and ``eN``)

    Parameters

    eB: float, optional
        on-site energy for Boron atoms
    eN: float, optional
        on-site energy for Nitrogen atoms
