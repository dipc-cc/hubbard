To do so you just need to pass the argument `nkpt=[nkx, nky, nkz]` when creating the `hubb.HubabrdHamiltonian(...)` object. This argument will set the number of $\\mathbf k$-points along each direction in which the Hamiltonian will be sampled in k-space. I.e. if the system is periodic only along the $x$-axis, you should pass something like `nkpt=[nkx, 1, 1]`, where `nkx>1` (the larger this number is, the better the sampling and the slower the convergence process are)."

    "- 1. Before converging, you can plot the band structure of the pure TB Hamiltonian (`Hsp2`). One possible way is to do it with `sisl`. You can take a look at example [TB_01](https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial/blob/master/TB_01/run.ipynb). In this case, the system is periodic along the $x$-axis, so you should calculate the bands like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "band = sisl.BandStructure(Hsp2, [[0., 0., 0.], [1./2, 0., 0.]], 301, [r'$\\Gamma$', 'X'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Now you can converge using the routine `hubb.HubbardHamiltonian.converge(...)`, just as in example [MFH_1](../MFH_01/run.ipynb). Remember to initialize the spin-densities before convergence!\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Finally, you can visualize relevant physical quantities, such as the spin polarization per unit-cell and the band structure of the self-consistent solution. In exercise [MFH_1](../MFH_01/run.ipynb) there is an example of how to plot the spin polarization using the `hubbard` package. To plot the bandstructure of the converged Hamiltonian you can do the same as in 1., but using the self-consistent solution stored in `HH`: \n",
    "```\n",
    "band = sisl.BandStructure(HH.H, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about plotting functionalities in the `hubbard` package you can type `help(plot)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can compare the bandstructure of the system for the pure TB Hamiltonian (before convergence) and of the self-consistent solution (after convergence).\n",
    "You should see a gap opening between the valence and conduction bands with respect to the non-converged solution. Such gap is called the correlation gap, and it appears because of the interaction between electrons."
