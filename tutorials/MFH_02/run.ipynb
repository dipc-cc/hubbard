This argument will set the number of k-points along each direction in which the Hamiltonian will be sampled in the k-space. I.e. if the system is periodic only along the x-axis, you should pass something like `nkpt=[nkx, 1, 1]`, where `nkx>1` (the larger this number is, the better the sampling and the slower the convergence process are)."
