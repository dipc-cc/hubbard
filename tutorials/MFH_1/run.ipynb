    "\n",
    "Now you can use the `hubbard` capabilities to perform further simulations on the molecule from the example above.\n",
    "For example, as the molecule has an even number of total electrons, the total charge associated to the up- and down-spin channels is by default equally distributed among them (`Qtot/2` each).\n",
    "Therefore, in this scenario the self-consistent solution found above corresponds to the approximated \"singlet\" configuration, because the projected spin is calculated as $S_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\left| Q_{\\uparrow} - Q_{\\downarrow}\\right| $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can manipulate and compute the solution for other magnetic states, by imposing an imbalance between the total charge corresponding to up- and down-spin components (i.e., exploring different $S_z$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to find the approximated \"triplet\" solution, where $S_z=1$, we have to impose a spin up and down charge imbalance of $Q_{\\uparrow} = Q_{\\downarrow} + 2$. In the calculation one just have to set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "HH.q[0] += 1 # Increase up total charge (Qup) by one unit\n",
    "HH.q[1] -= 1 # Decrease down total charge (Qdn) by one unit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and converge again.\n",
    "\n",
    "After convergence, you can plot the spin polarization of the ferromagnetic solution and compare with the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also compare the total energy of each calculation, this will tell you which solution corresponds to the ground state.\n",
    "The *new energy* will be saved in the variable `HH.Etot` (which will overwrite the previous one, that's why we saved it in the vriable `E_0` above).\n",
    "So you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "E_1 = HH.Etot # Save total energy of the new calculation in variable E_1\n",
    "print(E_1 - E_0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And actually, the energy difference between these two calculations ($E(S_{z}=0)-E(S_{z}=1)$) give us the approximated *singlet-triplet transition* energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "The result of the energy difference should give you: $E(S_{z}=0)-E(S_{z}=1)=19$ meV. \n",
    "You can go to the [referenced paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08060-6) and compare with both the DFT and MFH calculated energies, and also with the experimental value and see the agreement between these results.\n",
