    "In this example we will study the electron correlations in an open-quantum system, and find the self-consistent solution using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism within the `Hubbard` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will reproduce the results presented in [Phys. Rev. B 81, 245402 (2010)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.245402) for the system shown in Fig. 3(a). This is, a zigzag graphene nanoribbon with a defect created by removing certain atoms in the central region. This open-quantum system is composed by a central region that contains the defect coupled to two semi-infinite leads or electrodes (left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "For these systems and using the NEGF formalism, we are able to find the transmission probabilities per spin channel.\n",
    "Look into example [TB_04](https://github.com/zerothi/ts-tbt-sisl-tutorial/blob/master/TB_04/run.ipynb) for more information about how [TBtrans](https://launchpad.net/siesta) and [sisl](https://sisl.readthedocs.io/en/v0.10.0/api.html) can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the equilibrium situation, therefore the temperature and chemical potentials of the electrodes *must coincide*. The complex contour that we use to integrate the density matrix in the `Hubbard.NEGF` class is extracted from a [Transiesta](https://launchpad.net/siesta) calculation performed for a temperature of `kT=0.025` eV, which we will set as common for all the composing element calculations.\n"
