Examples
========

These examples will show how to use the `hubbard` package to solve the mean-field Hubbard (MFH) equation to simulate electron interactions in graphene nanostructures.

One can also go through the `examples <https://github.com/dipc-cc/hubbard/tree/master/examples>`_ section in the main repository to explore more systems suitable to solve with the hubbard package.
