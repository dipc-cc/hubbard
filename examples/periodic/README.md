Electron correlations in periodic systems
=========================================

In this example we will create the HubbardHamiltonian object of a system
with periodic boundary conditions, and find the self-consistent solution
using the mean field Hubbard model.

We will use as a reference the graphene nanoribbons of ref. [Phys. Rev.
B 81, 245402
(2010)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.245402)
and benchmark the results published there. You can also navigate through
the [periodic systems examples
section](https://github.com/dipc-cc/hubbard/tree/master/examples/periodic).

1.  We will start by building the tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian for the
    sp2 carbon-based graphene nanoribbon, by first building the
    [sisl.Geometry](https://sisl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-generated/sisl.Geometry.html)
    object. You can find the parameters used to model the TB Hamiltonian
    in the referenced paper above.
2.  We will build the HubbardHamiltonian object, which will allow us to
    use the routines stored in this class to converge until we find the
    self-consistent solution.
3.  Then we can plot some physical quantities that may be relevant after
    the calculation with the Hubbard package.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import Hubbard.hamiltonian as hh
import Hubbard.sp2 as sp2
import Hubbard.density as density
import Hubbard.plot as plot

# Build sisl.Geometry object of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon of width W=16 C-atoms across,
# e.g., by using the function sisl.geom.zgnr.
# This function returns a periodic graphene ribbon along the x-axis.
g = sisl.geom.zgnr(16)

# Build tight-binding Hamiltonian using Hubbard.sp2 function
Hsp2 = sp2(g, t1=2.7, t2=0.2, t3=0.18, s1=0, s2=0, s3=0)

# Build the HubbardHamiltonian object with U=2.0 eV at a temperature of kT=1e-5 in units
# of the Boltzmann constant.
# We have to use a k-points grid along the periodic direction to find the self-consistent solution per k-point
HH = hh.HubbardHamiltonian(Hsp2, U=2.0, nkpt=[100, 1, 1], kT=1e-5)

# Let's plot the band structure of the pure tight-binding Hamiltonian
# i.e., before finding the mean-field self-consistent solution
p = plot.Bandstructure(HH)
p.savefig('bands_TB.pdf')

# Let's initiate with a random density as a starting point
HH.random_density()

# Converge until a tolerance of tol=1e-10
dn = HH.converge(density.dm, tol=1e-10)

# Let's plot some relevant physical quantities, such as the final spin-polarization per unit-cell
p = plot.SpinPolarization(HH, vmin=-0.4, vmax=0.4)
p.savefig('spin-pol.pdf')

# and the band structure of the self-consistent solution
p = plot.Bandstructure(HH)
p.savefig('bands_MFH.pdf')
